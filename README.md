# Air-Pollution
This project is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server built using Node.js + Express.js that interacts with the OpenWeather API. It allows users to fetch air pollution data based on latitude &amp; longitude or city &amp; country. The backend ensures secure API key management using dotenv and handles API requests efficiently.
